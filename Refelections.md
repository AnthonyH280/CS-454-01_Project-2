# CS-454-01_Project-2-Reflections

As with other projects like this, I find that installation and making sure that
the path is ACTUALLY working properly gives me the most issues. This is mostly due
to the fact that I myself usually don't do things with command consoles, so having most of the
installations of needed architectures being console instructions was a bit difficult at times.
As sometimes they would not work properly and I would have to spend time looking for solutions
for something I NEED to even get started with the project itself.
